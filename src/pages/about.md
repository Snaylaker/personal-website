I'm Mehdi a FullStack Developper currently based in Paris.
I graduated from engineering school with a physics and embeded system degree but decided to follow the web developpment, although a raspberryPi is never out of reach.
what got me hooked into web dev is the ability to build anything from everywhere.

Currently, I'm working mostly with TypeScript and React to build fullstack web apps.
On the side, I have been solidifying my knowledge on algorithms and datastructures.
Exploring new frameworks and new ways of doing things.
